    <h1>Our Policies and Procedures</h1>

    <div>
        <h3>Schedule and Hours</h3>
        <p>All sessions must be scheduled in advance as we do not offer public hours. Most shoots are available between 3:30 PM and 6:00 PM Central on weekdays. Weekend availability varies due to high demand.</p>

        <h3>Adult/Parent Presence and Participation</h3>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Booking Policy</h3>
        <p>The photographerâ€™s total portrait session fee includes a non-refundable payment of 25% of the total session cost, which must be paid along with the signed contractual agreement. A portrait session date will not be reserved until both are completed. The non-refundable payment is earned by the photographer in consideration of the photographer's skill, experience, and the inability to book other clients during the reserved time.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Rescheduling and Late Arrivals</h3>
        <p>If the client requests to reschedule, the photographer may apply the initial payment to a rescheduled session if notice is given at least seven (7) days prior to the original session. The rescheduled session must take place within six (6) months. Late arrivals will have the lost time deducted from the session, with no partial refund or compensation provided. Sessions may be rescheduled due to inclement weather, at the photographer's discretion, to protect equipment and ensure quality.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Cancellation</h3>
        <p>If the client cancels or alters the session at least seven (7) days before the scheduled date, the non-refundable payment will be applied to a rescheduled session. For cancellations within seven (7) days of the scheduled date, the non-refundable payment will be forfeited.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Photography and Videography</h3>
        <p>The client is not permitted to engage in any photography or videography during the session unless agreed upon in advance by the photographer. Violating this policy will result in the session being terminated without a refund or reschedule.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Completion Schedule</h3>
        <p>All session proofs will be processed and ready for viewing between six (6) and eight (8) weeks after the event date. The photographer will determine product delivery schedules. The use of third-party manufacturing partners may impose restrictions on orders not outlined in this agreement.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Copyright and Reproductions</h3>
        <p>The photographer retains copyright ownership of all works created during the session, including original and processed formats. Duplication, alteration, or unauthorized use of images is strictly prohibited without written permission from the photographer. This includes but is not limited to applying filters, cropping, or any modifications.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Client Usage</h3>
        <p>Clients may only use photographic prints or digital files in accordance with the permissions granted in the portrait session agreement. Prints are for personal use only and cannot be used for commercial purposes or entered into contests without explicit permission from the photographer. Additional prints and digital files may be purchased with permission.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Social Media</h3>
        <p>The client may share web or blog post links and social media albums using the share functions or direct links.
